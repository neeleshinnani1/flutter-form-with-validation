## About the app

This is a simple login form with validation created with Flutter. It is created with Stateful Widget pattern.

This app covers the following concepts from flutter:

- GlobalKey, for referencing form fields to retrieve their values and access functions such as validation and save form value from children classes
- Simple form layout by creating Container Widget directly in the children property of a class
- Intro of _Mixin_ to create validation methods that can be reusebale in multiple places in the app.
